Question : Create a React component that displays a list of books. The book data should be stored in a JSON file and loaded dynamically using an AJAX request. Each book should display the title, author, and cover image. When a book is clicked, the user should be taken to a detail page that displays additional information about the book.

Requirements:

1. Use React functional components.
2. Use React Router for navigation.
3. Use CSS to style the component and make it responsive.
4. The list should be sortable by title, author, and publication date.
5. The detail page should display the book's title, author, cover image, publication date, and summary.

Hints:

1. You can use the fetch() function to load the JSON data.
2. You can use the map() function to iterate over the book data and create a list of books.
3. You can use the Link component from React Router to create links to the detail pages.
4. You can use the use History hook from React Router to programmatically navigate to the detail page.
